1. I think the ideal Network Graph would need to address or have the option to address 
a variety of tasks. As the networks and how they are used varies a lot on GitHub,
the most successful graph would allow for some flexibility in layout that the user can 
specify. Having said that, for all users, the Network Graphs primary role is to give
an overview of that repository. 
	Important task, that help create this overview are as follows:
	1. Show Connections
		For a successful Network Graph, this should include several types of connections,
		and includes:
			-Connections between commits and users. 
			-Connections between branches
			-Connections between users and branches
		
	2. See Activity
		Once again, there are several activity categories to look at. 
			- User activity
			- Activity on a branch
			- Commit activity  
			
	From the reading for this question  (Lee et al., 2006). I would say the graph-related
	tasks would be sort and scan. I feel sort and scan apply both to seeing connections 
	and seeing activity. For example a successful network graph would allow the viewer
	to sort the branches (either physically on the screen or visually), and then 
	scan that branch for user activity. I feel in this graph the sort and scan complement
	each other. Based on the reading, it could be said the graph task taxonomy could be
	Adjacency and Connectivity. From the description, connectivity includes finding the 
	most direct connections, identifying groups and identifying connected components, all 
	of which are important in this graph. Adjacency is described as finding nodes which 
	are next to one another. I feel Connectivity better fits the role of this graph, 
	though either could apply.

	3. Larger data sets get cluttered very easily, and it becomes harder to see the 
		connections. It's also much more difficult to view it all on the screen, so it 
		looses the ability to allow a user to quickly scan all the data.
